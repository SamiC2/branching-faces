Building a Keras model to predict all the classes in this faces dataset


### Overview

This notebook focuses on pickled preprocessed image data. The model was built using a Keras model that utilizes shared hidden layers, branched output layers that involve categorical and binary outputs, and finally compiled to determine the accuracy and training of the model.
